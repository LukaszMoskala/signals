# Run Signal Example

This example shows how to use the `signals` package for managing and handling synchronous and asynchronous signals. Sync and async code is written in `sync.go` and `async.go` files
respectively. To run the example, execute the following command:

```bash
# Run sync example
go run example/main.go
```

```bash
# Run async example
go run example/main.go -async
```
